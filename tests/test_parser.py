"""
Test the interpreter on all example files in the tests/
directory. Each file should contain bytecode and a commented section
like this:

# TEST_DATA
# expected = ...
# expected_stack = ...
# expected_heap = ...
# END_TEST_DATA

which state the expected output of the parser and interpreter to test
against.
